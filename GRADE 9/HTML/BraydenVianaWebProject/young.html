		<p>Kentrell DeSean Gaulden (born October 20, 1999), known professionally as YoungBoy Never Broke Again[2][3] (also known as NBA YoungBoy[a] or simply YoungBoy), is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Between 2015 and 2017, Gaulden released eight independent mixtapes, and steadily garnered a cult following through his work. In late 2017, Gaulden was signed to Atlantic Records, who distributed two additional mixtapes. In January 2018, Gaulden released the single "Outside Today", which peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[4] The song was the lead single for his debut studio album Until Death Call My Name (2018) which peaked at number 7 on the US Billboard 200. His follow up singles included "Valuable Pain", "Slime Belief", and "Genie".

Gaulden's first chart-topping project was AI YoungBoy 2 (2019), which debuted and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200.[5] It included the singles "Self Control", "Slime Mentality" and "Make No Sense". Gaulden also collaborated with the late rapper Juice Wrld on "Bandit", which became his first top-ten single. [6] In April 2020, he released his sixteenth mixtape 38 Baby 2, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Later that year, Gaulden released his second studio album Top (2020) which became his third chart topping album in less than one year.[7]</p>

		<p>Kentrell Gaulden was born on October 20, 1999, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Gaulden broke his neck while wrestling as a toddler, the injury requiring a head brace until the spine healed. The brace left permanent scars on his forehead.[8] Gaulden was raised mainly by his maternal grandmother due to his father being sentenced to 55 years in prison.[8] He dropped out of ninth grade and told his mom he wanted to focus on his music career and was soon arrested[when?] for robbery and sent to a detention center in Tallulah, Louisiana. While there, he began writing lyrics for his debut project.[2]

After he was released from the detention center, Gaulden's grandmother died of heart failure and Gaulden moved in with his friend and fellow Baton Rouge rapper, NBA 3Three (also known as OG 3Three). The two then used acts of criminality to begin to pay for studio time.[8]</p>
