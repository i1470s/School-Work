Despite being relatively restricted to an Atlantic sustenance, Portuguese cuisine has many Mediterranean influences. Portuguese cuisine is famous for seafood, and the Portuguese are among the nations that consume more fish in the world, per capita.[1] The influence of Portugal's former colonial possessions is also notable, especially in the wide variety of spices used. These spices include piri piri (small, fiery chili peppers) and black pepper, as well as cinnamon, vanilla and saffron. Olive oil is one of the bases of Portuguese cuisine, which is used both for cooking and flavouring meals, raw. This has led to a unique classification of olive oils in Portugal, depending on their acidity: 1,5 degrees is only for cooking with (virgin olive oil), anything lower than 1 degree is good for dousing over boiled fish, potatoes and vegetables (extra virgin). 0.7, 0.5 or even 0.3 degrees are for those who do not enjoy the taste of olive oil at all, or who wish to use it in, say, a mayonnaise or sauce where the taste is meant to be disguised. Garlic is widely used, as are herbs, such as bay leaf, coriander and parsley. In fact, Portugal is the only European country to use coriander as a fresh herb, in food and salads, and it makes an indispensable ingredient in Açorda, a type of bread porridge, vastely appreciated in the Alentejo region.
