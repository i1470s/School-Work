<p> In around 30 ish years computer have become smarter, lighter, and cheaper and almost everyone has a phone 
we came from a time where this stuff was very epensive and hard to get to it being absolutly everywhere and thats crazy
all modern pcs still run of older inveted stuff like there bridge that makes the cpu work or the PCIE slots for your graphics
card everythings the same just being make faster and faster a gen 1 16X pcie slot transfers data at 10/mbs
a second and the new gen 4 16X pcie slots work at 30/Gbs a second thats way crazyer. its not just pcie slots 
power supplys have gotten quieter and more powerful, Vrms (Vrms provide power to your CPU) on your mother board have gotten smaller
and more power effecent. Even new Mother boards need extra fans to cool there chips (chips control audio power delivery, etc) because there doing
so much and over heating real badly.
