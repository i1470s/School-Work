<p>Computers were made in the early 1970's the first one taking up 1800 sqfeet and wighing 27 tons. As of right know your phone weights a bought 2 grams thats crazy, in only 50 years we made something that weighs 27 tons weigh about 2 grams
if thats not crazy then i dont know what is, but of course your here to learn about old computers so let me tell you a little something about old computers they ran off of the old and still used x86 bridge witch is still one of the most stable platforms,
and isnt it crazy how back in the day if you awnsered your home phone your internet would cut out? thats crazy! who thought that would be a good idea they must have been crazy. also the very first consumer pc in 1972 cost around $5800 american
and to think you can go buy a latop for only 200 bucks nowadays is totally crazy also the fist "laptops" werent a thing till the 1976s and the first real laptop did not come out until the 1980s and yet they still cost $2000 american. heres a little video and photo of old Laptops.
<p>so they were clearly pretty beefy compared to what we have today its truly crazy how much they'ved changed its insane. </p>
