There are somany different components that make your PC work without them you wouldnt be able to do anything like your <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Asus-ROG-Crosshair-VIII-Motherboard/dp/B07SZXBTNW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AQJ3ATR17QW3&keywords=asus+x570+crosshair+viii+hero&qid=1573837015&sprefix=Asus+x570+cr%2Caps%2C233&sr=8-1">motherboard</a> 
or your <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/AMD-Ryzen-3700X-16-thread-processor/dp/B07SXMZLPK/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=RYZEN+7&qid=1573836866&sr=8-5">CPU</A> Without these your computer cant work and i can ensure you it wont work without a PSU (power supply) or <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/G-SKILL-F4-3200C16D-16GTZR-Trident-288-Pin-DDR4-3200MHz/dp/B01MTDEYHU">RAM</a> it provides your apps/prosecess it takes code from its self and sends it to the CPU and then it aprears on your screen in the form of animations, pictures, websites, etc. All these components are essenial to making your computer work and of course they come in different shapes
sizes and colors its all up to you. An extra option if your going to play videogames or edit videos your going to need a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/20-series/">GPU</a> (graphics card unit) because the small GPU in your CPU is pretty bad of course there getting better but they wont be a viable option for a few years.
