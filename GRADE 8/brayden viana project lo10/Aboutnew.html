New computers still run on the old intel X86 bridge and while many components have evolved this one has not, Lets talk quantum computing a computer almost as fast as the human brain its so fas infact that its used to make amazing programs/applcations google and microsoft both have quantum computers free for developers to use to make programs/applications and even work on AI (Artifical inteligence) witch is pretty cool.
did you know right now as of november 2019 you can make an amazing pc for around 600 bucks. 
Perfect for gaming photo editing or 
whatever task u throw at it heres an example <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rH4sZf">PCbuild</a> Its a pretty
good rig for the money over time these computers have become faster, 
better and more reliable. But of course
as time goes on new inventions come out like RGB it stands for red green and blue but were talking LEDs here,
people put LEDS in there computers to make them look better my personal rig has tons of RGB strips and fans.
Heres a comparison Photo between a new computer verses an older rig.</p>

<p>As you can tell these computers look so much different from the 80s/90s and in many ways not just components the chassies used to be made of cheaper
plastics where as now a days there either made of aluminum or steel making them much much stronger and more durable.
But its not only hardware that has changed OS or operating systems have changed so much in the past 20 years windows, linux and macOS have
had HUGE improvements over the past few years weither that be making your computer faster or making software run better on your
pc theres always something there improving.</p>
